# PrettyLinks Manager Chrome Extension

## Overview
PrettyLinks Manager is a Chrome extension that enables users to manage WordPress PrettyLinks directly from their browser. It provides functionality for creating, editing, and managing shortened URLs across multiple WordPress sites.

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Chromium-based browsers (v88+)
- Manifest V3 compliance

### WordPress Requirements
- WordPress 5.0+
- PrettyLinks Pro plugin installed and activated
- - PrettyLinks Developer Tools plugin installed and activated
- REST API enabled
- Valid API key configured in an admin account

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Background Service Worker** (`background.js`)
   - Handles extension initialization
   - Manages storage operations
   - Processes API requests
   - Implements request caching

2. **Popup Interface** (`popup.html`, `popup.js`)
   - Main user interface
   - Link management functionality
   - Site selection and configuration
   - Search and pagination
   - Link creation form

3. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Link extraction from web pages
   - Link insertion into editors
   - Editor type detection (WordPress, Google Docs, etc.)

4. **Options Page** (`options.html`, `options.js`)
   - Site configuration management
   - API key storage
   - Connection testing

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger popup interface actions
2. Popup sends requests to background service worker
3. Service worker manages API communication
4. Content script handles page-specific operations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security
- API keys stored in Chrome's sync storage
- HTTPS-only API communications
- Content security policy enforcement
- Input sanitization for all user inputs

### State Management
- Chrome storage sync for persistent data
- Local caching for API responses
- Site-specific data management
- Pagination state tracking

### UI/UX Standards
- Material Design-inspired components
- Responsive popup layout
- Loading states for async operations
- Clear error messaging
- Consistent button styling
- Accordion-based site management

### API Integration
- REST API endpoints:
  - GET /wp-json/pl/v1/links
  - POST /wp-json/pl/v1/links
  - DELETE /wp-json/pl/v1/links/{id}
  - GET /wp-json/pl/v1/links/{id}
- Response caching (5-minute TTL)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting consideration
